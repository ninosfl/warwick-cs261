# API for front-end/back-end communication

For now, this is wildly incomplete - but you can test it out as it is!

Once you have the web server running, with `python3 manage.py runserver`, you can test out the api with: `curl localhost:8000/api/`, or by making your way to `http://localhost:8000/trades/`.
